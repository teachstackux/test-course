# Hello World

## Learning
Welcome to your first Python coding challenge! You will learn how to write a simple Python program and understand how the ```print()``` function works.

Python is a popular, beginner-friendly programming language. One of the first tasks every programmer undertakes when learning a new language is writing a Hello World program. This is a simple program that displays the message "Hello World!" on the screen.

In Python, we use the ```print()``` function to display output from our program. This will appear in the 'Output' window on the right-hand side of the screen. The print function takes text or other information inside the parenthesis and outputs it to the console.

Here's how you can write your first program with Python:

- To display a simple message saying "Hello World!" you can use the print function as follows: ```print("Hello World!")```. Type this into the main.py file open in the text editor in the middle of the screen.

- Use the 'Run Program' button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen to run your code. Once you've managed to print "Hello World!" to the console, try changing the double-quotes ```"``` to single-quotes ```'``` and see what happens.

- When you are finished, click the 'Next' button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to progress to the next exercise.
