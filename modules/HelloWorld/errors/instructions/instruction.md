# Errors

## Learning
Humans are famously prone to errors—just ask anyone who’s ever sent a text message to the wrong person or accidentally added salt to their coffee instead of sugar. Coding is another discipline where we unwittingly make mistakes. Thankfully, Python comes equipped with helpful features to catch and report errors so you can fix them before they cause chaos.

Two common errors you’ll encounter as a beginner are ```SyntaxError``` and ```NameError```. SyntaxError is Python’s way of saying, “This doesn’t look like proper code to me!”. A NameError happens when Python tries to find a variable or name that doesn’t exist.

This is a small script that is guaranteed to throw both of these errors. Your mission? Debug it and bring it back to order. First, try running the code to see how Python displays errors. Then get to work.

You can fix the ```SyntaxError``` by amending the mismatched quotation marks. Then if you run the code, you should encounter the ```NameError```. You can fix that by correctly encasing the Teachstack string in quotation marks (```'``` or ```"```).
